# Genetic Biomarker Analysis for Leukemia Classification

Overview: 

This project focuses on the identification and classification of genetic biomarkers that distinguish between Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL). Leveraging statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, the study aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform personalized treatment approaches.

Key Features: 

- Comparative Genetic Analysis: Conducted an in-depth comparison of genetic biomarkers between AML and ALL using mRNA expression data.
- Predictive Model Development: Developed a predictive model using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multiple Logistic Regression, achieving 96% accuracy in disease classification.
- Collaborative Research: Co-authored and presented findings in an 18-page research paper alongside a Stanford Ph.D. graduate at the Lumiere Education Symposium.

Tools and Technologies: 

- Statistical Methods: ANOVA
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Multiple Logistic Regression
- Programming Language: Python

Objective:

The primary goal of this project was to determine accurate genetic classifiers that contribute to improved leukemia diagnosis and enable tailored treatments based on patient-specific conditions.

Highlights:

- Achieved high classification accuracy (96%) through rigorous data analysis and model optimization.
- Provided insights into the role of genetic biomarkers in distinguishing leukemia subtypes.
- Presented research at the Lumiere Education Symposium, demonstrating the practical implications of the findings for medical diagnostics.
